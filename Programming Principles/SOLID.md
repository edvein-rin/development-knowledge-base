It's important to note that **SOLID is not only about classes and OOP**. It's about functions and other things as well.
## **S** - Single-responsibility Principle
Class (or not only) should only do one thing and should have only one reason for a change.
## **O** — Open-closed Principle
Class should be open for modification and closed for mutation.
## **L** — Liskov Substitution Principle
Class can be replaced by any of its children.
## **I** — Interface Segregation Principle
A class should not be forced to implement methods it doesn't need.
## **D** — Dependency Inversion Principle
Higher-order modules should not depend on lower-order modules, and both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on implementation details.
