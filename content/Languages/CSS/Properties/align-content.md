`align-content` sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a **flexbox**'s cross axis, or a **grid** or **block-level** (!) element's block axis [^1].

> [!WARNING]
> It works with `flexboxes`, `grids` and `blocks`  differently.
> Here is [an interactive example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content#result) of the difference.
